# WildGuard
WildGuard is an AI-powered wildlife detection system that uses YOLOv5 and OpenCV to detect animals (especially elephants) and send real-time alerts to prevent human-wildlife conflicts. It logs detections into an SQL database and displays them on a web interface instantly for monitoring.
